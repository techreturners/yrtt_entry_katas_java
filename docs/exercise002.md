# Exercise 002

In this set of exercises we're going to explore the creation of your own objects.

You'll see a number of tests in [Exercise002Test.java](../src/test/java/com/techreturners/exercise002/Exercise002Test.java)

You'll be required to create Java objects (classes) to represent a "Person".

A Person has 4 properties/data associated with them:

* Their first name
* Their last name
* Their city
* Their age

You'll need to look at the methods and tests and update accordingly.
