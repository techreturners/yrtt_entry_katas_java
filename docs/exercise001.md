# Exercise 001

This set of Java challenges introduce exercises for working with the Java syntax.

It includes:

* Methods, variable definitions and data types
* Conditionals
* Looping
* Initial review of Java objects

In the [Exercise001Test.java](../src/test/java/com/techreturners/exercise001/Exercise001Test.java) file you'll find the tests - work through each test and implement the corresponding function within the [Exercise001.java](../src/main/java/com/techreturners/exercise001/Exercise001.java) file.

You can run your tests by running the following command:

```
mvn test
```
